Hi, my name is Radhika Desai. I'm a software developer with a strong passion for building scalable and efficient web applications. Over the past few years, I’ve sharpen my skills in various programming languages and frameworks, but my expertise lies particularly in Node.js and related technologies.

[Cut to screen showing a list of skills]

My technical skill set includes proficiency in JavaScript, Express.js, MongoDB, and RESTful API development. I also have experience with front-end frameworks like React, HTML and CSS, which allows me to build full-stack applications.

[Cut back to you]

In addition to technical skills, I have a knack for problem-solving and a sharp eye for optimizing performance and scalability. Now, let me tell you about a project that showcases my capabilities with Node.js.

The project I want to share with you today is called 'Gift E-commerce Website'. It's a modern online platform powered by the MERN stack. It features a seamless, user-friendly interface, robust filtering options, and an adaptive design, providing a delightful shopping experience across all devices.

[Cut to a diagram of the project architecture]

Here’s an overview of the project architecture. The application follows a RESTful design, where the Express.js server handles HTTP requests, and MongoDB stores the data. The front end, built with React, communicates with the server via API endpoints.

One of the key techniques used in this project is asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await. This approach ensures that our server can handle multiple requests efficiently without getting blocked.

"Let me show you an example. Here, we have an API endpoint for adding new gift products. We use the async/await syntax to handle database operations. This not only makes the code cleaner and more readable but also improves error handling.


[Highlight specific lines in the code]

As you can see, we use a try-catch block to catch any errors that may occur during the database operation. This way, we can send an appropriate response back to the client, ensuring a smooth user experience.
